A comprehensive R package offering datasets on diabetes trends in the US, from historic records to current statistics. Whether you're tracking prevalence, analyzing risk factors, or exploring treatment outcomes, this package delivers the data you need.

## Installation

You can install the development version of 'diabeetus' like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jpmonteagudo28/diabeetus")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
